## ⚡ MVP Goals

Kronoscan’s initial release will focus on:

- **Offline-First Experience**  
  Users can create, edit, and view events and tasks entirely offline with local storage (IndexedDB on web, SQLite on mobile).

- **Core Calendar Views**  
  Basic Month, Week, and Day views to navigate and manage your schedule intuitively.

- **Event & Task Management**  
  Add, edit and delete events and tasks with key details like title, time, description, and optional tags.

- **Backend API**  
  A .NET Web API providing:
  - User authentication (optional sign-in)
  - Data sync endpoints to keep multiple devices updated
  - Proxy and aggregation of external APIs, starting with weather data, to enrich user experience

- **External API Integration**  
  Fetch real-time weather information relevant to the user's location.  
  Additional APIs (e.g., job postings, policy alerts) may be integrated in future updates.

- **Basic Conflict Resolution**  
  Handle simple sync conflicts with last-write-wins logic.

- **Cross-Platform Support**  
  Web app (React + TypeScript) and mobile app (React Native with Expo), sharing core business logic and models.
